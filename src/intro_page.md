# What I Did Last Week

Welcome! This service builds a weeklog of all the different activities you spent time on in the last 7 days.

We access

* Jira (server)
* Zendesk
* Freshdesk (ddna ticketing system)

using the email supplied when you log into Google.

Additionally, if you provide consent:

* Google calendar meetings.

We don't store any of this, so you'll need to log in again each time you visit the service.

Note, after logging in the service may take ~2-3 minutes to build the report. It's a raspberry pi and I've not implemented async web requests yet.
